When you start a new journey, you may need a supporter. Being a full time mom, a house maker I needed a strong support system to study Web Development. 

And person who was always there for me is my husband. So, I would like to dedicate my final project to him. He actually works as an Accountant with New Your Life Insurance but he is also a part time realator.

I am building a website that will help him to get more clients for the real estate project.

The website will have following features:

* User can serch for a home through address and will be able to see all of the information about that home from Zillow API
* User will also be able to see the strret view of that home through Google Map API
* User will be able to calcute approx monthly morgage for their future home loan depends on current interest rates and term of loan
* Contact page to contact Trushal Chitalia
* Home page for some information
